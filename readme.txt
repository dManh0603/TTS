Microsoft Speech API
The Speech Application Programming Interface 
or SAPI is an API developed by Microsoft to 
allow the use of speech recognition and speech 
synthesis within Windows applications. To date, 
a number of versions of the API have been released, 
which have shipped either as part of a Speech SDK, 
or as part of the Windows OS itself. Applications 
that use SAPI include Microsoft Office, Microsoft 
Agent and Microsoft Speech Server.
